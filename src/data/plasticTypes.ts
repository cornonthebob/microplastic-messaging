    structure: 'Linear thermoplastic polymer created through polycondensation of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. Contains benzene rings connected by ester linkages (-COO-). The aromatic structure provides rigidity and strength while the ester bonds contribute to its degradability under certain conditions. PET has a semi-crystalline structure with amorphous and crystalline regions, typically 30-40% crystallinity in commercial products. Molecular weight ranges from 15,000-30,000 g/mol. Glass transition temperature is approximately 76°C and melting point around 250°C.',
    formation: 'Formed through esterification: HO–C₆H₄–COOH + HOCH₂CH₂OH → HO–C₆H₄–COO–CH₂CH₂OH + H₂O\nFollowed by polycondensation under high temperature (250-280°C) and vacuum.\nCatalysts include antimony trioxide (Sb₂O₃), titanium-based compounds or germanium oxide.\n\nIndustrial synthesis often uses dimethyl terephthalate route:\nCH₃OOC–C₆H₄–COOCH₃ + 2HOCH₂CH₂OH → HOCH₂CH₂OOC–C₆H₄–COOCH₂CH₂OH + 2CH₃OH\n\nPolycondensation proceeds with continuous removal of ethylene glycol to drive reaction forward:\nn(HOCH₂CH₂OOC–C₆H₄–COOCH₂CH₂OH) → (–OCH₂CH₂OOC–C₆H₄–CO–)n + nHOCH₂CH₂OH',
    concerns: 'May leach antimony trioxide catalyst and acetaldehyde when exposed to heat. Studies have found antimony migration up to 100 times faster at 60°C versus 20°C, with migration rates of 0.1-0.3 ng/cm² per day under normal conditions. Antimony is classified as a possible human carcinogen by IARC. Acetaldehyde migration (from thermal degradation) typically ranges from 20-200 μg/kg, below regulatory limits but potentially contributing to total chemical exposure. PET can leach several other compounds including phthalates, formaldehyde, and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, especially after repeated use and washing. Studies suggest potential endocrine disruption effects when microplastics form, with in vitro studies showing estrogenic activity in human cell lines. When degraded into microplastics, PET absorbs and concentrates contaminants from environment including persistent organic pollutants (POPs), with partition coefficients (Kp) up to 10⁶ for some compounds.',
    processing: 'Recyclable (Code #1). Often collected, cleaned, melted and reformed. Mechanical recycling degrades polymer chains through hydrolytic and thermal processes, decreasing molecular weight by 10-25% per cycle. Virgin and recycled PET are often blended to maintain properties. Chemical recycling methods include methanolysis, glycolysis, and hydrolysis which break down PET into monomers or oligomers for repolymerization. However, approximately 70% ends up in landfills or environment where it slowly fragments into microplastics over 450+ years. Global PET recycling rates vary significantly: 31% in US, 48% in Europe, 84% in Japan. In landfills, PET contributes to leachate with detectable levels of antimony and organic compounds. When incinerated, PET produces carbon dioxide, water, and trace amounts of aromatic compounds and antimony oxide.',
    biodegradability: 'Not readily biodegradable under normal environmental conditions. Takes hundreds of years to degrade in natural environments. Theoretical complete biodegradation would follow: (C₁₀H₈O₄)n + 10nO₂ → 10nCO₂ + 4nH₂O, but actual processes are much slower with half-lives of 450+ years in marine environments. Enzymatic degradation has been demonstrated with certain microorganisms like Ideonella sakaiensis that produce PETase enzymes, which hydrolyze ester bonds but at very slow rates. These enzymes are being studied for potential bioremediation applications and accelerated PET recycling. Photodegradation and mechanical abrasion cause fragmentation into smaller microplastics rather than complete breakdown, with studies showing approximately 0.08% weight loss per year in marine environments. Under industrial composting conditions (58°C, high humidity, microbial activity), minimal degradation occurs, typically less than 5% after 180 days.',

    abbreviation: 'HDPE',
    fullName: 'High-Density Polyethylene',
    structure: 'Linear polymer with minimal branching, consisting of repeating ethylene (–CH₂–CH₂–) units with high crystallinity. HDPE typically has 70-80% crystallinity with a density of 0.941-0.965 g/cm³. The linear structure allows polymer chains to pack closely together, resulting in high tensile strength (20-40 MPa), stiffness, and chemical resistance. HDPE has a molecular weight ranging from 200,000-500,000 g/mol. Melting point is approximately 130-135°C with a glass transition temperature below -100°C. The polymer contains predominantly C-C and C-H bonds, which are highly resistant to chemical attack but susceptible to oxidation under certain conditions. Commercial HDPE typically includes additives such as antioxidants, UV stabilizers, and sometimes colorants.',
    formation: 'Produced via Ziegler-Natta polymerization: nCH₂=CH₂ → –(CH₂–CH₂)n–\nUses catalysts (typically titanium and aluminum compounds) under low pressure (2-4 MPa) and moderate temperature (70-300°C).\n\nAlternatively produced using Phillips catalysts (chromium oxides on silica):\nCr²⁺/SiO₂ + nCH₂=CH₂ → Cr complex → –(CH₂–CH₂)n–\n\nModern processes often use metallocene catalysts for better control:\nCp₂ZrCl₂ + methylaluminoxane + nCH₂=CH₂ → –(CH₂–CH₂)n–\n\nPolymerization follows chain-growth mechanism:\nCatalyst-M + CH₂=CH₂ → Catalyst-M-CH₂-CH₂• (initiation)\nCatalyst-M-(CH₂-CH₂)n• + CH₂=CH₂ → Catalyst-M-(CH₂-CH₂)n+1• (propagation)',
    concerns: 'Generally considered one of the safer plastics but can release estrogenic chemicals when degrading. Studies have detected compounds like nonylphenol (1-20 μg/L) and bisphenol A (0.1-10 μg/L) in water exposed to HDPE, particularly after UV exposure or mechanical stress. These compounds have demonstrated endocrine-disrupting effects in aquatic organisms at concentrations as low as 1 μg/L. Additives including antioxidants (e.g., Irganox 1010), UV stabilizers (e.g., benzotriazoles), and colorants can leach from HDPE, especially when exposed to acidic or fatty substances. Microplastics from HDPE interact with persistent organic pollutants, potentially transferring these toxins into organisms. HDPE has been shown to adsorb polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations up to 100,000 times higher than surrounding water. The manufacturing process for HDPE releases volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, and greenhouse gases, with approximately 1.8 kg CO₂ equivalent emitted per kg HDPE produced. Workers in production facilities may be exposed to ethylene, catalysts, and various additives with potential health effects.',
    processing: 'Recyclable (Code #2). Can be processed into lumber-like products, drainage pipes, and other durable goods. Mechanical recycling involves sorting, washing, grinding, and remelting, with each cycle typically reducing molecular weight by 5-10% through thermo-oxidative degradation. Virgin and recycled materials are often blended at ratios of 60:40 to 80:20 to maintain performance properties. HDPE recycling is fairly efficient with relatively high purity streams and good mechanical property retention. Global recycling rates vary considerably: approximately 30% in US, 42% in Europe, and higher in some Asian markets. Non-recycled HDPE persists in landfills or environment, fragmenting into microplastics through mechanical weathering and UV exposure. Under landfill conditions, virtually no biodegradation occurs, though some additives may leach out. When incinerated, HDPE produces approximately 43 MJ/kg of energy with primary combustion products being carbon dioxide and water, though incomplete combustion can generate various hydrocarbons.',
    biodegradability: 'Not biodegradable under normal environmental conditions. Takes 100+ years to degrade. Theoretical complete mineralization follows: –(CH₂–CH₂)n– + 3nO₂ → 2nCO₂ + 2nH₂O, but actual degradation is predominantly abiotic. Degrades primarily through photodegradation, creating smaller and smaller plastic fragments. UV radiation generates free radicals: RH + hν → R• + H•, followed by oxidation reactions introducing carbonyl groups that weaken the polymer. Studies in marine environments show weight loss of approximately 0.05% per year. Under standard composting conditions, HDPE shows no significant biodegradation (<2% after one year). Some researchers have identified specific microbial strains (including Brevibacillus borstelensis and Rhodococcus ruber) that can partially degrade pre-oxidized HDPE under laboratory conditions, but rates remain extremely slow with biodegradation measured at 2.5-11% over 30-60 days under optimized conditions. Most "biodegradable" HDPE products rely on additive packages that promote fragmentation rather than true biodegradation.',

    fullName: 'Polyvinyl Chloride',
    structure: 'Vinyl polymer with chlorine atoms attached to carbon backbone: –(CH₂–CHCl)n–. Requires plasticizers to be flexible. PVC has an atactic structure with randomly oriented chlorine atoms, resulting in a primarily amorphous polymer with low crystallinity (5-10%). The presence of chlorine (57% by weight) contributes to PVC\'s flame resistance, chemical stability, and high specific gravity (1.3-1.7 g/cm³). Rigid PVC has a glass transition temperature of approximately 85°C. Flexible PVC properties vary widely based on plasticizer content (typically 15-60% by weight), with common plasticizers including phthalates (DEHP, DINP, DIDP), adipates, and more recently non-phthalate alternatives like DOTP. Commercial formulations contain numerous additives including heat stabilizers (lead, calcium-zinc, or organotin compounds), lubricants, impact modifiers, fillers, and processing aids. The molecular weight typically ranges from 50,000-120,000 g/mol, with higher values for rigid applications.',

    concerns: 'Contains chlorine (57% by weight). Releases toxic compounds including dioxins when burned. Phthalate plasticizers are endocrine disruptors that can leach out over time. Manufacturing process uses carcinogenic vinyl chloride monomer. Rigid PVC is relatively stable, but flexible PVC can leach significant amounts of plasticizers, with migration rates of 1-500 μg/cm²/day depending on conditions. DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate), a common plasticizer until recently, is classified as a probable human carcinogen and reproductive toxicant. Studies have shown plasticizer concentrations in indoor air (100-1000 ng/m³) and dust (100-1000 μg/g) from PVC products. Medical PVC has been associated with DEHP exposure in patients, with premature infants potentially receiving doses up to 20 mg/kg/day during intensive medical procedures. When incinerated, PVC produces hydrogen chloride gas and potentially chlorinated dioxins and furans, among the most toxic substances known. Dioxin concentration in incinerator emissions ranges from 0.5-10 ng TEQ/m³ without proper controls. The vinyl chloride monomer used in production is a known human carcinogen associated with angiosarcoma of the liver and other cancers. Worker exposure in production facilities has been linked to increased cancer risk, with historical exposures sometimes exceeding 1000 ppm (current limits are 1 ppm).',
    processing: 'Rarely recycled (Code #3) due to chlorine content and additives. Mostly sent to landfills where plasticizers can leach into groundwater. Incineration produces hydrochloric acid and dioxins. Post-consumer recycling rates are extremely low (less than 3% globally) due to contamination concerns, additive variability, and degradation during processing. Mechanical recycling is primarily limited to pre-consumer waste and specific applications like window profiles or pipes. Chemical recycling methods include VinyLoop process (selective dissolution and reprecipitation) and pyrolysis to recover hydrochloric acid and hydrocarbon oils. In landfills, flexible PVC loses plasticizers over time, with leachate concentrations of DEHP typically 10-100 μg/L. Under optimal conditions using modern air pollution control, PVC incineration can capture 99.9% of hydrogen chloride and reduce dioxin emissions to 0.1 ng TEQ/m³, though these standards aren\'t universally achieved. Specialized recycling technologies include the Vinyloop process, which selectively dissolves and reprecipitates PVC, recovering both the polymer and some additives. Some European countries have implemented PVC collection systems for specific applications (pipes, profiles, flooring) with recycling rates reaching 25-30% for these streams.',
    biodegradability: 'Extremely resistant to biodegradation, with estimated degradation times of 1000+ years. Plasticizers may biodegrade but the polymer backbone remains intact, shedding microplastics into the environment. Under laboratory conditions using selected microbial strains, minimal biodegradation (<1%) has been observed over extended periods. Theoretical complete mineralization would follow: (CH₂CHCl)n + 2.25nO₂ → 2nCO₂ + nH₂O + nHCl, but in practice, minimal mineralization occurs in environmental settings. Photodegradation occurs primarily through dehydrochlorination: –(CH₂–CHCl)n– + heat/UV → –(CH=CH)n– + nHCl, creating conjugated polyenes that cause yellowing and embrittlement. This process is autocatalytic, as released HCl accelerates further degradation. Weathered PVC releases microplastics at rates of approximately 0.02-0.1% per year in marine environments. In landfills, flexible PVC may lose up to 50% of plasticizer content over decades through leaching, while the polymer chain remains essentially intact. Some fungi species (Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Phanerochaete) have shown limited ability to degrade plasticized PVC under controlled conditions, primarily attacking the plasticizers rather than the polymer.',
